# carSuspensionMPC-QP

Simulation of a simple car suspension model going through a bumpy road. A controller using Nominal Predictive Controller is used and implemented with LQR reduced
to a quadratic problem using a dual-problem formulation. It is also used a solution using universal solver fmincon for comparison.
